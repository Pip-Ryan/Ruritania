# Ruritania
Welcome to the Republic of Ruritania.  Ruritania is an island nation in the South Pacific with a population of 5 million people. It is a wealthy country with a stable democratically elected government. It has an advanced, high-income economy that is among the fastest growing in the Southern Hemisphere.  Ruritania’s legal system is modelled on the Australian.   Due to its low-lying topography, Ruritanians are concerned about rising sea levels. There is a fear that if global warming melts the polar ice caps, sea levels will rise and much of the island will be inundated with water.  As part of its strategy to “Future-proof Ruritania”, the Government has introduced an e-citizen identity card modelled on the Estonian e-residency programme. Anyone from anywhere in the world, can (for a small administrative fee) become an e-citizen of Ruritania.  The idea is that if Ruritanians need to leave their island home, they will have established online business relationships with citizens from all over the world and they will be welcome to move to and re-settle in those locations.
